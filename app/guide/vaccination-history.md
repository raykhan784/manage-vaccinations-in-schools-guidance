[[toc]]

You should upload relevant historical vaccination records before scheduling school sessions. This allows Mavis to:

- identify which vaccinations a child has already had
- only send consent requests for children who have not had the vaccine already

If you later find out that a child has already been vaccinated, you can update their record in Mavis (see ‘Manually recording a child as already vaccinated’ below).

You should include vaccination records for anyone in the cohort who was vaccinated elsewhere, if you have them. These records will be stored in Mavis and will not be sent anywhere else.

Once a child’s record has been added to Mavis, any school age vaccinations they get at a GP practice are automatically added to their record in Mavis.

Before uploading vaccination records, read:

- [what to upload and when](/guide/what-to-upload-and-when/)
- [preparing files for upload](/guide/preparing-files-for-upload/)

## What vaccination history you need to upload

How much vaccination history you need to upload depends on the programme.

> [!NOTE]
> If you do not upload vaccination histories for a year group, but then you schedule a session that includes that year group, the parents of every child in that year will get a consent request, including those already vaccinated.

### Flu

Do not upload flu vaccination records from previous academic years.

Only upload a record if the flu vaccination was given in the current academic year.

### HPV

Upload records of any previous HPV vaccinations given to children in your cohort from age 9 onwards.

For example:

- if you’re vaccinating children in Year 8, upload records from the previous 4 years
- if you’re running a catch-up session for Year 10, upload records from the previous 6 years

### MenACWY

Upload records of any previous MenACWY vaccinations given to children in your cohort from age 10 onwards.

For example, if you’re vaccinating children in Year 9, upload records from the previous 3 years.

### MMR(V)

Mavis needs each child’s full MMR vaccination history from 12 months of age onwards.

This means you should upload vaccination history as far back as the oldest child in the cohort minus one year.

For example:

- if you’re vaccinating Year 6 children (where the oldest child is 11), upload records from the previous 10 years
- if you’re vaccinating Year 11 children (where the oldest child is 16), upload records from the previous 15 years

### Td/IPV

Upload records of any previous Td/IPV (3-in-1) vaccinations given to children in your cohort from age 9 onwards.

For example, if you’re vaccinating children in Year 9, upload records of Td/IPV vaccinations from the previous 5 years.

> [!NOTE]
> Do not upload records of any previous tetanus-, diphtheria- or polio-containing vaccines that are not Td/IPV, for example the 6-in-1 vaccine or the 4-in-1 pre-school booster. Mavis is not authorised to hold this information.

## How to upload vaccination records

Use this template:

{% from "attachment/macro.njk" import attachment %}
{{ attachment({
  text: "Vaccination records upload template",
  summary: "Microsoft Excel spreadsheet, 18 KB",
  href: "/files/historical-vaccination-records-upload-template.xlsx"
}) }}

Vaccination record files need to be in .csv format. Records can be all in one file, or split across multiple files. If you have an Excel file with multiple tabs, you will need to consolidate this into a single tab or create a separate CSV file for each tab.

For each of your vaccination record CSV files:

1. Go to the **Imports** tab.
2. Select **Upload records** near the top of the page.
3. Select **Vaccination records**, then **Continue**.
4. Select **Choose File**, then select the CSV file you want to upload.
5. Select **Continue**. If there are any validation issues, Mavis will not upload the file. Correct the issues listed in the file and try again.

### Checking the upload status

You can see whether your file successfully uploaded by checking its status in the list of uploads.

Once the file has finished uploading, it will no longer be visible in the **Incomplete uploads** tab. It will now be in the **Completed imports** tab.

### Upload errors

If your upload fails, see [Upload errors](/guide/importing-cohorts/#upload-errors).

## Resolving possible duplicates

After a file has successfully uploaded, Mavis highlights any potential duplicates as **close matches to existing records**, which you must resolve.

1. Go to **Imports** and select the **Completed imports** tab.
2. Select the date and time of the upload to view its details.
3. Under ‘Close matches to existing records - needs review’, select the upload issues link to see a list of possible duplicates.
4. Select **Review** for each record listed.
5. Select which version of the record you want to keep then select **Resolve duplicate**.

If there are some parts of each that are correct, you can note down any correct information from the version you choose to discard, discard it, then go to the child’s record and manually edit the information there (this feature will be more developed in a future release of Mavis).

> [!NOTE]
> You can view all unresolved close matches in the **Issues tab** on the Imports screen. This lists outstanding close matches from all uploads.

## Manually recording a child as 'already vaccinated'

If a child’s historical vaccination record is missing from CHIS data, or you have not been able to upload their historical vaccination record into Mavis, you can manually record the child as ‘already vaccinated’ for a specific programme.

1. From the dashboard, go to **Children**.
2. Search for the child then select their name to open the child record.
3. Select the relevant tab for the vaccination programme you want to record.
4. Select **Record as already vaccinated** at top of the page.

5. Enter the date when the vaccination was given (and the time if you know it).

   > [!NOTE]
   > You must know the date of vaccination in order to record it here. You do not need to know the time.

6. Check the details on the page and add a note to explain this was a historical vaccination, then select **Confirm**.
